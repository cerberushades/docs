Instead, with Signature (S), the claim is immediately ready for use. The biggest advantage of MT approach is that it offers timestamp proof of an identity state: a user could always prove the existence of a claim at a specific point in time according to the block number when it was added to the issuer tree. Naturally, this comes at a cost: the gas fees needed to update the state (458,228 gas used inside the transaction). No on-chain transactions take place in the case of S.  A further element of difference regards the uniqueness of the claim: in the MT case, there couldn\u2019t be two claims with the same index Claim Data Structure. This is guaranteed by the characteristic of Sparse Merkle Tree. With S, an issuer could sign as many claims they want with the same index. Let\u2019s consider an example: a passport issued as a claim. This claim contains the identifier of the passport owner inside its index. MT approach provides a cryptographic guarantee that the issuer cannot duplicate the passport by issuing a claim with the same identifier.
